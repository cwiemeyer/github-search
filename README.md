# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

 You need to own a Github account and create a personal access token for developers to access the Github V4 GraphQL API.
 On your account click 'Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Create new token'. 
 As a permission the "Access public repositories" have to be set.
 For information on how to do that, please see the Github documentation: 
 https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

 When you have done that, please create a file named '.env.local' within the main project folder after checkout 
 on your local machine and add the following line:
 `REACT_APP_GITHUB_API_TOKEN=your_token`

 To run tests locally, copy the '.env.local' file and name it '.env.test.local'.

 Make sure you do not push this file (it should be added to the .gitignore file already).

 For more information on that, please see the Github guide for this:
 https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/setting-up-your-development-environment-to-create-a-github-app

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
